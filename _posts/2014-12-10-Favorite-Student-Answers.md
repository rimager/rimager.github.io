title: Favorite Student Answers

I've been teaching Web Dev for a long time. From TAing during my grad student years at UF, to part-time and now full time at MIU. I've had a lot of fun with my students in all these years and it's been a great privilege to meet such a unique collection of talented individuals. 

There are times though when I'm grading some homework and the amount of confusion, lack of understanding, lack or interest, or even just lack of Googling skills a student shows in submitting their answer to a question is so overwhelmingly frustrating and, eventually, funny, that I simply could not resist compiling a Best Of with my _favorite answers to homework questions_. 

Note, I won't ever publish anyone's idenity. If you recognize yourself, I hope you'll be a sport, and chuckle about it. If it does bother you, you can always contact me to get off this list.

1. *Q: What is the "same-origin policy" and how does it relate to AJAX?*

A: The script page law. So you don't outsource your script to websites that don't allow it. With AJAX you can do this.

2. This one isn't really a question from a student, just the following statement. It's 1 minute before the end of class on the last day of classes and the Final Project is Due. 

Student: "So, I haven't been here for the last 2 weeks and I was wondering if you could quickly give me an example of how to use this API I've never used so I can start to work on my project."
